- Keep Medarcy's clinical content and interactions in client-side mock modules; this is a visual prototype without authentication or persistence, so future service integration can replace the mock boundary safely.
- Give each Medarcy workspace its own TanStack route and metadata; this keeps professional workflows navigable and shareable.
- Keep the appearance preference in local browser storage and apply it before paint via the root shell; the prototype needs a consistent theme without a backend or hydration flash.
- Provide appearance state from the shared shell to Settings via context; one preference source keeps theme controls and the toast appearance synchronized.
- Keep editable demo profile details in validated browser-local storage and share them from the shell; the visual prototype does not persist personal accounts or verify clinical credentials.
- Serve supplied Medarcy logo variants through asset pointers and select them with CSS theme classes; this keeps SSR branding stable while matching light and dark appearance.
- Keep the public MCP catalog read-only and sourced only from fictional prototype modules; unauthenticated agent access must never expose patient data or imply verified clinical evidence.
